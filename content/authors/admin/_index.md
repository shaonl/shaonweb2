Hi, I'm a social and behavioral scientist in the field of public health. I study social processes across a number of behaviors that impact health, such as modern contraceptive use, intimate partner violence, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis use, and tobacco consumption. My focus area is on the measurement, conceptualization, and influence of social norms on behavior across a variety of settings and contexts.
